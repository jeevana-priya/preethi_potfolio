        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I’m Preethi! As a Civil Engineering student, I’m all about the hands-on side of construction,
          diving deep into the technologies that power the process. From AutoCAD to the latest development
          software, I’ve honed my skills to bring ideas to life in the world of building and infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          What excites me most about civil engineering is the ability to combine practicality with innovation.
          It's not just about constructing buildings, but creating spaces that make a difference. I’m passionate
          about using modern tools and technologies to streamline development and make the process smarter, more
          efficient, and sustainable.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there’s another side to me – art. Whether it’s sketching, painting, or experimenting with new media,
          I love how art can bring a fresh perspective to everything, including my engineering work. I believe
          my creative touch gives me a unique edge in the construction world, blending technical expertise with
          an artistic eye to deliver solutions that are not only functional but aesthetically inspiring.
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, I’m a civil engineering student with a passion for construction technologies and a love for
          art – constantly seeking ways to fuse both to innovate in my field.
